# Realtime Charts in Javascript
Build realtime charts in Javascript using NodeJs and WebSockets.

We use PieSocket Channels to publish graph data from the NodeJS server every second.
Received data is then plotted on the frontend using ChartJS.

## Usage
Clone the repository
```
git@github.com:piesocket/realtime-charts-javascript.git
```

Install node depencies:
```
cd realtime-charts-javascript
npm install
```

Start NodeJS server
```
npm start
```

Open the following link in browser
```
http://localhost:3000
```
